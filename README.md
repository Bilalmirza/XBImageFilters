# XBImageFilters

XBImageFilters allows you to obtain filtered versions of any image or from the camera in realtime. It uses OpenGL ES 2 to filter the images through fragment shaders you write yourself so you can filter your images in whatever way you want and it is super fast.

Ps.: I have just started this project a few minutes ago hence there's nothing in here yet. If you're interested watch it to keep updated and eventually contribute to this idea.
